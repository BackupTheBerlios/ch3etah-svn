Incremental builds (nightly/weekly):
 - Code compiles and Unit tests pass
 - No showstopper bugs
 - Documentation might be incomplete or inconsistent
Releases: (every 3-6 weeks)
 - Code compiles and Unit tests pass
 - No showstopper bugs
 - Documentation should be consistent

Some major features to be implemented:
* Region support with hash code generation and checking
* SimpleEngine
* Assembly analyzer for reverse engeneering
* AppDomain isolation of template engines

BUG: If you call MetadataFile.Save() and it throws (like UnauthorizedAccessException) then MetadataFile.IsDirty no longer returns true, even though it was not saved successfully.
BUG: Adding xml comments (<!-- -->) just under Metadata tag (i.e. same level as entity tag will throw an exeption "The '#' character, hexadecimal value 0x23, cannot begin with a name." It apears that the comment node is being added to the grouped metadata with a key of "#" by the method GroupMetadataEntities in CodeGeneratorCommand.cs.
BUG: Xml comments are not ignored by XmlContext in the NVelocity engine.
BUG: Trace window output for single-output commands should indicate they are single-output.
BUG: Old ch3etah web generation project was loaded and Page command was converted to single-output when it should have been multiple-output.
BUG: In ch3etah web project, xml editor *always* asks you to save changes
BUG: When you delete a node from the project tree (data source, command, metadata file) the deleted object's content editor window is not closed
BUG: Exception thrown when all output path contains ${...} is uninteligible for single-outout commands - i.e. it says "couldn't evaluate... for metadata file 'NULL'."
BUG: Some newly added entities (see EmailConfiguration) always ask to save changes, even when none were made.
BUG: Entity name doesn't update in treeview when changed in property grid
BUG: There is way too much coupling between the OREntityEditor and it's children (like accessing the TreeView on the Design editor). This really needs to be refactored.

* FEAT: Need to add search dialog to text editor.
* FEAT: Nant script needs to copy changelog.txt to web directory
* FEAT: Should validate that links point to valid entities and warn if they don't (i.e. to avoid null ref exceptions when generating)
* FEAT: It really needs to be easier to create/edit packages with their included templates and sample projets
* FEAT: Add project-level parameters and project, metadata file, command, and template stencils to packages
* FEAT: Add data source CustomEntityAttributes to Package (and add a description to attributes)
* FEAT: Possibly add Description property to all key-value pairs
* FEAT: Rename Core.CodeGen.PackageLib.InputParameter to TemplateParameter and add a description
* FEAT: TemplateParameter needs to be able to accept typed values so that values other than string can be added to the generation context (similar to CodeSmith)
* FEAT: Need to implement configurable template loaders so that different engines can have specific features/functionality associated with their templates (like allowing CodeSmith templates to be parsed to find the required parameters)
* FEAT: Add evaluation syntax to allow metadata entities to be passed to generation context parameters as strongly typed objects rather than just XML ( ex: ${CurrentMetadataFile::Entity[0]} )
* FEAT: Add a "Rename" command to metadata file right click menu [possibly implement an INamedObject with SupportsRename() and Rename(string newName)]
* FEAT: Add support for Stored Procedure (SP) metadata for generating stron-typed data access commands. Should have option to use stored XML or refresh from DB every time code is generated (AutoRefreshSchema - possibly same for OREntities).
* FEAT: Enable visual styles
* FEAT: In ORM settings, add list of field names to exclude automatically, like SiteID, ReplicationID, etc.
* FEAT: Remove/Exclude deleted fields, indexes and links when entity is refreshed from db (or mark IsExcluded=true), and advise user (have option in settings)
* FEAT: Add ability to include/exclude nodes in entity editor tree via right-click
* FEAT: Parameterize naming of metadata files created from datasource
* FEAT: Put property browser below and put object editor forms to the side in MetadataFileEditor
* FEAT: Issue with toolbar buttons on entity editor screen
* FEAT: Add changed events to properties in project and metadata
* FEAT: Add 'Text Encoding' option to code generator command (A saída do Velocity está sendo feita em UTF-8. Até aí, nada de mais, uma vez que temos usado apenas ASCII. Porém, peguei um sistema legado que tem nomes de campos acentuados. Adivinha o que acontece com o script SQL quando ele pega um arquivo UTF-8... Precisa mudar a saída prá ANSI ou ISO-8859-1.)
* FEAT: Installer needs to make sure program isn't running
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Check_whether_your_application_is_running_during_uninstallation
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Detect_if_a_window_is_open_and_close_it.
* FEAT: We should look at migrating WeifenLuo docking suit to 1.0+, though not for this release. http://sourceforge.net/users/weifenluo/

* WISH: Visual UML-style modeler. Should use Model-View-Presenter pattern and code to interfaces so that other types of metadata entities (e.g. XMI) can be plugged into the modeler.
* WISH: Manage multiple files in project structure (i.e. select several metadata files and remove them)
* WISH: Allow organizing of metadata files into sub directories
* WISH: We would like to have a simple Entity object and extend it with functionality and attributes such as O/R mapping, GUI-specific, framework-specific, etc. One possible way of acheiving this could be to use the decorator pattern or similar. We would need to figure out how the decorations would show up on editing screens, in property grid, etc. It would also be nice to have it configurable at runtime to make it easier to create/configure/discover/experiement with extending entities without having to create a VS.NET project for the extension and compile it.
