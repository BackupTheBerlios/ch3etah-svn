- BUG: Adding link when another link is selected in treeview messes up tree
- BUG: Object editor captions not being shown on tabs
- BUG: There is no UI feedback when adding multiple tables from datasource

- BUG: If you add a new, non-OREntity-related, node to the entity in xml mode, it always thinks the entity is dirty.
- BUG: Turn off recording of temp xml files during generation
- BUG: Entities are not being selected automatically in generator commands - need to change package structure
- BUG: Object isn't highlighted in treeview anymore when you switch object editor windows
- BUG: Include text editor mode files in post build event
- BUG: Data source guid is null
- BUG: Entity fields should be added in DB order, not alphabetical
* BUG: When you delete a node from the project tree (data source, command, metadata file) the deleted object's content editor window is not closed
* BUG: Entity name doesn't update in treeview when changed in property grid
* BUG: 

- FEAT: Check to see if file has changed before overwriting
- FEAT: Have better handling (like VS.NET) when metadata files aren't found (change icon and allow removal/renaming)
- FEAT: Update any associated entities when the datasource name is changed
- FEAT: Add command to remove datasource
- FEAT: Add global error handling
- FEAT: Excluded metadata nodes need to have their icon be visibly different.
- FEAT: Delete to exclude, Insert to include, and shift + delete to remove fields, indexes and links
- FEAT: Change "Remove Metadata File" to "Exclude From Project" and add "Delete Metadata File"
- FEAT: Keyboard support (enter, delete, etc) in project and entity trees
* FEAT: Add a "Rename" command to metadata file right click menu [possibly implement an INamedObject with SupportsRename() and Rename(string newName)]
* FEAT: Enable visual styles
* FEAT: In ORM settings, add list of field names to exclude automatically, like SiteID, ReplicationID, etc.
* FEAT: Remove/Exclude deleted fields, indexes and links when entity is refreshed from db (or mark IsExcluded=true), and advise user (have option in settings)
* FEAT: Add ability to include/exclude nodes in entity editor tree via right-click
* FEAT: Parameterize naming of metadata files created from datasource
* FEAT: Put property browser below and put object editor forms to the side in MetadataFileEditor
* FEAT: Issue with toolbar buttons on entity editor screen
* FEAT: Add changed events to properties in project and metadata
* FEAT: A saída do Velocity está sendo feita em UTF-8. Até aí, nada de mais, uma vez que temos usado apenas ASCII. Porém, peguei um sistema legado que tem nomes de campos acentuados. Adivinha o que acontece com o script SQL quando ele pega um arquivo UTF-8... Precisa mudar a saída prá ANSI ou ISO-8859-1. [Add 'Encoding' option to code generator command]
* FEAT: Installer needs to make sure program isn't running
